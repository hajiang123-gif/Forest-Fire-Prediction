# Forest-Fire-Prediction
This project leverages Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict forest fires based on historical fire occurrence data and weather conditions. Forest fires are increasingly destructive due to climate change, and predictive modeling can help in early warning systems, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation.

By training a predictive model on past fire incidents and associated weather reports (e.g., temperature, wind speed, humidity, rainfall), the system aims to forecast future fire occurrences with improved accuracy.

#Data
The dataset used in this project is the UCI Forest Fires dataset, which contains meteorological data and fire occurrence records in the Montesinho natural park in Portugal. The features include temperature, humidity, wind, rain, and several spatial and temporal attributes. Some features in the dataset include but are not limited to:

Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)
Duff Moisture Code (DMC)
Drought Code (DC)
Outside temperature
Day and month
